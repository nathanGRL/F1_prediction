Welcome to the F1 Prediction Project! This repository provides a comprehensive, relational database schema and data model for Formula 1 racing, suitable for analytics, visualization, and application development.

Overview

This project organizes Formula 1 data into structured tables, enabling efficient querying and analysis of races, drivers, constructors, circuits, results, standings, and more. The schema is designed for flexibility and accuracy, reflecting the complexity of real-world F1 seasons.

Features

Comprehensive Schema: Covers all core F1 entitiesâ€”races, drivers, constructors, circuits, results, standings, lap times, pit stops, and more.

Relational Design: Tables are normalized and linked by primary and foreign keys for efficient joins and queries.

Accurate Data Types: Uses appropriate SQL types (INT, FLOAT, TEXT, DATE) for each field, supporting both integer and fractional points.

Prediction target : predict race finishing positions and constructor finishing race postition 

Extensible: Easily add new seasons, races, or entities as F1 evolves.
